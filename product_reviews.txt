['\n\n  First let off is the adapter for charging the mobile is not provided. The problem is you need a type c adapter which you have to buy separately. Most importantly, it is not available from website to buy original samsung adapter. So you pay 80k to buy a phone without the adapter and then you buy a duplicate adapter for 3k...Dont buy this phone\n\n', '\n\n  Samsung processor is worst even 10 min of normal usage it gets heated upBattery life is very badSometimes freezes which is shameOnly camera is fine rest all i worstEven my s8 plus was far better than rhisTottaly waste of money\n\n', '\n\n  Processor is fast.\n\n', '\n\n  Samsung flagship doesn‚Äôt need any introduction but here is what i have liked and disliked in my usage since last couple of months.1. Exceptional screen - super smooth fluid screen. Colours are rich. Switch between 60 and 120 hz option is available.2. Pro camera - I am really impressed. I still prefer Google Pixel for camera in a phone and I believe no camera phone in the market can beat that. But the ‚ÄúPro‚Äù mode on this phone is too good. Gives DSLR like features. It is super awesome. Normal camera is also very very good. I am attaching some of the photos taken from this.3. Average battery life - it is ok. Gives one day backup with average use (4-5) hrs screen time.4. Fingerprint sensor doesn‚Äôt work with tampered glass - None of the tampered glass available in the market works with in screen-fingerprint sensor. It is better not to use fingerprint sensor if you decide to apply a tampered glass. I am using it without any screen protector. But i am using a flip cover.\n\n', "\n\n  Amazon mentioned wrong terms condition about bundle offer active 2 smart watch, samsung terms condition are different for redemption.

Impressive camera. Try clicking picture of moon uzing 30x zoom and the results would be surprising.2. Exynos 2100 is way better than the previous gen processor and at par with Snapdragon 8883. Very good battery life. Light usage will take you to 1.5 to 2 days without charging.4. One thing everyone misses is the adaptive refresh rate which helps in saving battery.5. It's Samsung display panel! Come on!6. Toughest gorilla glasse yet both front and backOverall I found great features and according to me it's worth the price I finally had to pay!\n\n", '\n\n  I upgraded from Samsung s8+ to Samsung s21+.

Great performance and battery life. Don't be disssuaded by the Exynos chip, it's plenty fast even when compared to the Snapdragon 888 in the OnePlus 9 Pro. Battery life is plentiful and heats a bit while charging but stabilises soon. Overall great value for money. Great option if you're looking for a brand change as well.\n\n", '\n\n\n  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n\n\n  \xa0Phone is overheating with basic usage (105+)\n\n', '\n\n  S21 plus has a great screen, good battery life, excellent camera and I did not find any heating issues with the phone.

Have to be very careful.\n\n', "\n\n  This is my first Samsung phone, to be honest not disappointed at all. I love the phone, it's easy to use, takes great vibrant pictures even though it might sometimes feel unreal and functions well as a work phone without any issues. Still it's not apple and I will continue to use them side by side. I would recommend to purchase this phone to anyone who has doubts whether to choose this over other phones in the category & price range.\n\n", '\n\n  Good camera quality, battery lasts about12 hours, however heating issue still persists. Overall, good phone\n\n', '\n\n  I would have given 5 stars if my phone box was not opened and resealed. Other than that, the phone is awesome.For my usage, the battery lasts for 24hrs.The only bug it has is, when I use the camera everytime I click a photo the charge goes down by 1%, that too in high resolution mode. So for ten clicks approximately 8 to 10 % of battery is lost. None of the other apps drains battery that much.\n\n', '\n\n  Overall experience is nice. Camera is good. Performance of 2100 processor is fine too. Night mode is kind of average. Gaming experience is not the best but better than the previous generation. I think, SD865 is still the most stable process. 2100 and SD888 is based on 5nm architecture, which produces more heat.\n\n', "\n\n  It's not user friendly device, hard to use\n\n", '\n\n  Good phone with a nice battery.Easy to useLitbit it get heats in the beginning.Again it cools down.No more problems.Camera is good.New and different types of modes in the camera.Amazing.Just go for it.Price is heavy.Overall good.\n\n', "\n\n\n  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n\n\n  \xa0The best s series phone !!!

Samsung s21+ is just a gimmicksThis is my review on Exynos 2100 model in factory  conditions because i have already did factro reset twice believing this might be my faultEven after you paying 85k you get Exynos modle in india Exynos is not at all equivalent to SnapdragonThe camera has poor quality  where M51 photos were far better than this. Camera app will hang if you try to switch between the lenses this really sucks if you use camera for 3mins there will be huge lag in clicking the pics this really made phone ridiculous since you have used the phone camera for a while the phone will be heated badlyüò¢Battery is ok if you switch off 5g and adaptive screen refreshIf you are looking for more details in the pics then its better not to use secondary lenses8k is just there as a feature its better to use 4kPro mode is better than autoPeople use to choose Samsung than oneplus jus they had memory card slot even this has been removed fron s21Also you wont get adapter, if you want to enjoy superfast charging then you have to buy oneALL THESE YEAR YEARS SAMSUNG USE TO SAY USE CHARGERS WHICH COMES IN THE BOX FOR BETTER BATTERY LIFE NOW I DON'T  KNOW WHAT IS THE CAPTIONI'm writing more about camera because this is the only feature  i use the most  and the next is gaming.since  your paying 86k for 40worth phoneSamsung is forcing us to buy their earbuds or smartwatch by giving 10k discount. Its better to think before you buy this phoneIts better to go to s20 fe its worth every pennyCont.. after 3months of usageVideo capture in slow mo is worst when you play the captured video looks snappy every second it will create a very cheap phone impressionAfter few updates camera has improved but not upto expensive phone range it still struggle to capture photos within a secondPost update Dex is not stable at times if it cants handle hi res cideos or games it wil jus exit and this was one of the main reason i bought Samsung premium phone#samsungindia\n\n", "\n\n  Galaxy S21+ is no doubt a premium device, loved the phantom silver color.The build quality is top notch feels a lighter, the weight balance on Galaxy S21+ is amazing.In terms of specifications and performance, Just one Word Flagshipüî•120hz display, it feels good and seamless.The camera setup is just amazing with all those great features, but i really loved the Night Mode and Director's view on Galaxy S21+The camera will surely 10/10 on this one, gives fabulous results and never Disappoints.Overall it's a great device to own, no matter what tasks you throw into it, it will give amazing results for sure.\n\n", '\n\n  Worst product.better go for s10 plus or note 10 plus. Worst for this price point...dont waste your hard earned money.\n\n', "\n\n  I purchased the Samsung Galaxy S21 plus 8 /256 Gb model from Amazon for 74k and also received the active watch 2 (costs around 20k in the market) for just Rs 990. I could have got it for even cheaper with the Amazon ICICI cash back (another 5%) but opted for the no cost emi instead. So effectively I got the phone for 55k which still as per me is quite expensive. However I think with all the flagship features and camera quality it is justifiable. Now coming to the review:Pros:1)Head turning design and build quality. This has to be one of the most beautiful looking phone currently in the market. The glass back with matte finish is so satisfying to touch.2)Camera is one of the best for a flagship device. I don't need the additional zoom of ultra so this 3 camera setup is perfect for any given scenario. I am specially happy with the quality of the ultra-wide lens in both normal and low light conditions. Lots of options for quality videos as well.3) Superb full HD+ 120 HZ adaptable display. I am sure the display on the ultra is better on paper but to my naked eyes I was not able to find much of a difference.4)Top notch Exynos SoC. This is my first Samsung flagship so never had any experience with earlier version of Exynos chipsets, but there is no doubt that the 2100 is an able performer and can run/play all the latest apps/games without any issue.5)Big 4800 mAh battery easily lasts me 2 days with moderate level of usage.6)IP 68 rating, wireless/reverse wireless charging, on-screen ultrasonic finger print scanner, 5G support... has all the flagship features.7)Samsung one UI is extremely feature full and also they are going to provide 3 years of android updates.Cons:1) Wired fast charging is limited to 25 watts and no charger is provided in the box. Extremely poor decision by Samsung by trying to mimic Apple in this regard. Since this is my first Samsung smartphone, I had to buy the 25 watt Samsung branded fast charger separately.2) Wireless charger can charge at 15 watts but with most 3rd party fast chargers, fast charging doesn't work. Some users have complained that this feature was removed after a recent software update. So now  need to buy a separate Samsung fast wireless charger. WHY SAMSUNG???3) If you use a tempered glass screen protector, chances are that either the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor will not work or it will take at least 2-3 attempts to get it recognised correctly.I have been a Oneplus user since their beginning . But I am no longer a supporter of Oneplus's recent business choices and hence decided to move over to Samsung which no doubt is very expensive but with all these extra features, I have no regrets so far.\n\n", '\n\n  Amazing phone, worth waiting phoneCamera, OS everything is updated, very smoothGreat release by the Samsung this time.üòäüòäüòäüòäüòä\n\n', "\n\n  Samsung's best üëçWhat's Good üåü -Camera is great.Battery performance is at its best.Display is smooth with a 120hz adaptive refresh rate.Its big screen is AMOLED and hence millions of colours.Tips-If you purchase it from the Samsung store you could get more discounts. Check once before buying it online. I also got Samsung active watch 2 by paying Rs 990 only. Good deal.Charging adapter not included in box. Just type c to c cable included inside. Also no free case along with the phone.\n\n", '\n\n  Feels comfortable in hand, battery life is decent,  provides full day usage. Camera is extremely good in day light and night as well.
